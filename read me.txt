Firstly make sure that you have installed two 3rd-party softwares which have been included in the OpticalFlow and SurfaceRecover subfolders. They are used as parts of our code for simplicity. Then you can run our codes in demo.m and the results of our code are saved in the output subfolder.

The 3rd party softwares of optical flow [1-3] and surface reconstruction [4,5] can also be downloaded from:
